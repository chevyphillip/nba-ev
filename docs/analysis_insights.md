# NBA Analysis Insights

## Overview

This document provides detailed insights from our NBA data analysis, combining statistics from Basketball Reference and the NBA API. Our analysis focuses on both player and team performance metrics, offering a comprehensive view of the current NBA season.

## Player Analysis

### Player Versatility

Our versatility analysis identifies players who excel across multiple statistical categories. The versatility index considers:

- Scoring (points per game)
- Playmaking (assists)
- Rebounding (total rebounds)
- Defense (steals + blocks)
- Efficiency (true shooting percentage)

Key findings are visualized in radar charts showing how top versatile players contribute across different aspects of the game.

### Scoring Efficiency
